# MLOps

Welcome to my MLOps blog series! I'm **Raghu Hemadri**, a machine learning researcher focusing on **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**. This series draws from my experience in an MLOps course led by **Professor [Fraida Fund](https://witestlab.poly.edu/~ffund/)**, an expert in scaling ML models for production.

Throughout these posts, I'll walk you through essential MLOps conceptsâ€”from automation and model deployment to monitoring and workflow management. My goal is to share practical insights that will help you build and maintain production-ready ML systems. Stay tuned!
