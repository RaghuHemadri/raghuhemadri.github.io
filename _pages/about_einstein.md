I am **Raghu Hemadri**, a **Machine Learning Researcher** with a strong focus on **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**. Currently, I am working under the supervision of [Prof. Siddharth Garg](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/siddharth-garg) at NYU, exploring **LLMs for hardware design**. My latest research involves **real-time hardware code analysis**, a collaboration with **Synopsys**. Currently, I am collaborating with **Microsoft Research** on **domain-specific LLM fine-tuning and distillation**.  

Beyond my research in LLMs, I also work with [Siddharth Nayak](https://nsidn98.github.io/) (PhD @ MIT) on developing **human-interpretable multi-agent RL (MARL)**, leveraging multimodal AI for effective coordination and decision-making.

Previously, I worked as a **Member of Technical Staff** at **Oracle**, where I developed ML-based log anomaly detection, automated bug detection, and large-scale recommendation systems.  

Apart from my research, I am a **professional badminton player**. Badminton has instilled in me discipline, strategic thinking, and resilience—qualities that also translate into my research mindset. Beyond badminton, I enjoy playing and watching **cricket**.

I am currently on the **job market for 2025 summer internships**.
