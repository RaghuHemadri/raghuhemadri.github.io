I am **Raghu Vamshi Hemadri**, a **Machine Learning Researcher** with a strong focus on **Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Reinforcement Learning (RL)**. Currently, I am working under the supervision of [Prof. Siddharth Garg](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/siddharth-garg) at **New York University**, exploring **LLMs for hardware design**. My latest research involves **real-time hardware code analysis and vulnerability detection**, a collaboration with **Synopsys**. Additionally, I am collaborating with **Microsoft Research** on **domain-specific LLM fine-tuning and distillation**.  

Beyond my research in LLMs, I also work with [Siddharth Nayak (MIT)](https://nsidn98.github.io/) on developing **human-interpretable communication protocols in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)**, leveraging multimodal AI for effective coordination and decision-making.

Previously, I worked as a **Member of Technical Staff at Oracle**, where I developed **ML-based log anomaly detection, automated bug detection, and large-scale recommendation systems**.  

Apart from my research, I am a **professional badminton player**. Badminton has instilled in me discipline, strategic thinking, and resilience—qualities that also translate into my research mindset. Beyond badminton, I enjoy playing and watching **cricket**.

I am currently on the **job market for 2025 summer internships**.  

### **Contact Me**  
I am always open to discussing **LLMs, reinforcement learning, and engineering/science-related ideas**. If you have an exciting idea, feel free to drop me an **email**. Also, if you’re up for a game of **badminton or cricket**, I’m always in—whether it's playing or watching a great match!
