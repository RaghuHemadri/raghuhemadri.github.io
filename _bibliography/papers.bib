abstract={In recent years, applying Deep Learning (DL) techniques has emerged as a common practice in the communication system, demonstrating promising results. The present paper proposes a new Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based Variational Autoencoder (VAE) communication system. The VAE (continuous latent space) based communication systems confer unprecedented improvement in the system performance compared to AE (distributed latent space) and other traditional methods. We have introduced an adjustable hyperparameter {\$}{\$}{\backslash}beta -{\$}{\$}VAE in the proposed VAE, which is also known as {\$}{\$}{\backslash}beta -{\$}{\$}VAE, resulting in extremely disentangled latent space representation. Furthermore, a higher-dimensional representation of latent space is employed, reducing the Block Error Rate (BLER). The CNN based VAE architecture performs the encoding and modulation at the transmitter, whereas decoding and demodulation at the receiver. Finally, to prove that a continuous latent space-based system designated VAE performs better than the other and 4n dimensional representation is better than 2n representation, various simulation results supporting both have been conferred under normal and noisy conditions.},

abstractNote={Human child trafficking has become a global epidemic with over 10 million children forced into labor or prostitution. In this paper, we propose the ChildrEN SafEty and Rescue (CENSER) system used by the Guria non-profit organization to retrieve trafficked children from brothels in India. The CENSER system is formed of the proposed Memory Augmented ScatterNet ResNet Hybrid (MSRHN) network trained on three databases containing images of trafficked children at different ages, their kins, and their sketches. The CENSER system encodes the input image of a child using the proposed Memory Augmented ScatterNet ResNet Hybrid (MSRHN) network and queries the encoding with the (i) Age, (ii) Kinship, and (iii) Sketch databases to establish the child’s identity. The CENSER system can also predict if a child is a minor, which is used along with their identity to convince law enforcement to initiate the rescue operation. The MSRHN network is pre-trained on the KinFace database and then fine-tuned on the three databases. The performance of the proposed model is compared with several state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract="The purpose of color quantization is to reduce colors in an image with the least parody. Clustering is a popularly used method for color quantization. Color image quantization is an essential action in several applications of computer graphics and image processing. Most of the quantization techniques are mainly based on data clustering algorithms. In this paper, a color reduction hybrid algorithm is proposed by applying Jaya algorithm for clustering. We examine the act of Jaya algorithm in the pre-clustering stage and K-means in the post-clustering phase, and the limitations of both the algorithms are overcome by their combination. The algorithms are compared by MSE and PSNR values of the four images. The MSE values are lower and PSNR values are higher for the proposed algorithm. The results explain that the proposed algorithm is surpassed both the K-means clustering and Jaya algorithm clustering for color reduction method.",
